# wordsearch
A CLI implementation of a scrabble/boggle-like word search game.

This project was completed for the [edX MIT 6.00.1x Intro to Python](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.00.1x_7+3T2015/info) course.

If you're in that class right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
